Tapalot
-------


ruby app to help bands play cover songs

first release:
take bpm value
take measure value
print out measure according to bpm and uom


second release: 
given number of measures and beats,
it will show the beats for measure times.

third:
parse song structure
tap and show according to song structure


===========================

To do / To think about:
. Conductor 'initialize' function knows about Song structure,
is this necessary? There is a bit too much coupling

. Metronomes are instantiated for every Song Section,
not intuitive to create a new 'counter' object for different section
is it possible to stop / reset / re-assign parameters to existing metronome ?

. Test sucks, is it an indication of bad design ?
in some cases, heavy mocking, also in other cases not DRY

. Conductor.run function is too big
tried to do too many things ?

. Conductor coupled tightly with Console ?








want to do:
x parse input file (bpm, change in unit of measure, pauses, instruments)
x run metronome
x play and show song structure.
. easy keyboard control to repeat, stop, change bpm
. hook with mp3 and try to play the specific section of song
. want decimal number for number of measures
. want way to define when an instrument enters
. only show song structure that will be played ?
. Show measure count alongside verse ?



sample:

instruments:
g1: lead guitar
g2: guitar 2
